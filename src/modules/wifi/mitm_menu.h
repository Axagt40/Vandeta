/**
 * @file mitm_menu.h
 * @brief On-device UI and payload files for the net_spoof MITM engine.
 *
 * The engine itself (net_spoof.cpp) was written for the JavaScript bindings and
 * is unchanged: arpSpoof / dnsSpoof / httpInterceptor still drive it. This file
 * adds the two missing pieces so the same attacks can be used without a script:
 *
 *   - the `DNS Inject` and `HTML Intercept` entries of WiFi > Wifi Atks, built
 *     on the engine's public API only;
 *   - the payload files those menus load from the card.
 *
 * Payload files (on the mounted filesystem, SD first):
 *
 *   /BruceSpoof/*.mitm          ONE payload for the whole attack (see below)
 *   /BruceSpoof/dns.txt         one rule per line:  <domain> <ip>
 *                               `* <ip>` answers every query, `#` comments.
 *   /BruceSpoof/redirect.txt    one rule per line:  <pattern> <url>
 *   /BruceSpoof/html/*.html     an injected page (must fit one ethernet frame)
 *
 * The unified payload (MITM Attack page, `.mitm`, `.txt` or `.html`) is the
 * keypad-free way to describe a whole run. It is a plain-text list of commands,
 * one per line, `#` for comments - a thin, readable front end for the same
 * engine the JavaScript API exposes:
 *
 *   page <match> <file>         httpInterceptor.addInjection()   200 + HTML
 *   redirect <match> <url>      httpInterceptor.addRedirect()    302
 *   dns <name|*> <ip>           dnsSpoof.addRule() / startAll()
 *                               (<ip> may be `gateway` or `this`; the token is
 *                               resolved on each query, so the payload loads
 *                               even while the station is still down)
 *   target all|<ip>             arpSpoof.start() - overrides the page's mode
 *   fallback dns <ip> [secs]    if nothing was injected/redirected in <secs>
 *   fallback redirect <url> [secs]   ... try this instead (default 10 s)
 *                               Chain up to 3 `fallback` lines; each <secs> is
 *                               measured from the start, and a step only fires
 *                               while the attack still has no hit.
 *   info                        log the network facts (SSID/channel/board IP,
 *                               gateway IP + MAC) before the poison starts
 *   probe all|<ip>              log what is actually there: an ARP resolve per
 *                               address, `all` reuses the scan the pairing did
 *   forward off|auto|on         bridge the victim to the real gateway so it
 *                               keeps internet (a redirect can then load)
 *   offline page <file>         served instead of the redirect when the bridge
 *                               cannot start (no internet path without it)
 *
 * `info` / `probe` are read-only reconnaissance - they never start a pair or
 * change a rule, so a payload can report what the target is and still use the
 * same page/redirect/DNS lines afterwards.
 *
 * A `.html` payload is simply `page * <that file>`.
 *
 * Nothing here sets up WiFi on its own beyond asking the station to associate:
 * the engine needs a real association because the frames go out on the keyed
 * station link (see the note at the top of net_spoof.h).
